    "\n",
    "In the first part of this exercise, you will explore how to create and interact with a Clipper cluster. The primary way of managing Clipper is with the Clipper Admin Python tool. This tutorial will walk you through all the things you can do with the Clipper Admin tool as well as explain what happens within Clipper when you issue each command. You can find the complete API documentation for the Clipper Admin tool on our website: <http://docs.clipper.ai>.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Be familiar with how to create and manage a Clipper cluster, and understand what happens when you issue Clipper admin commands."

    "### Context\n",
    "The Clipper Admin tool is distributed through Pip. You can install it with `pip install clipper_admin`, but it has already been installed in this notebook for you, in the first cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clipper is built on top of Docker containers. A running Clipper cluster consists of a collection of Docker containers communicating with each other over the network. As you issue commands against Clipper, you are communicating with these containers as well as creating new ones or destroying existing ones. As you explore the Clipper API throughout this exercise, we will illustrate how each command effects the cluster state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main API for interacting with Clipper is exposed via a [`ClipperConnection`](http://docs.clipper.ai/en/develop/#clipper-connection) object. This is your handle to a Clipper cluster (this collection of Docker containers). It can be used to start, stop, inspect, and modify the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to create a `ClipperConnection` object, you must provide it with a [`ContainerManager`](http://docs.clipper.ai/en/develop/#container-managers) object. While Docker is becoming an increasingly standard mechanism for deploying applications, there are many different tools for managing a Docker cluster. These tools broadly fall into the category of *Container Orchestration frameworks*. Some popular examples are [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/), and [DC/OS](https://dcos.io/). One of the reasons we run Clipper in Docker containers is to make the system as general as possible and support many different deployment scenarios. Within the Clipper Admin, we abstract away all of the Docker container-specific commands behind the `ContainerManager` interface. The `ClipperConnection` object makes Clipper-specific decisions about how to issue commands, and then makes any changes to the Docker configuration (for example, to launch a container for a newly deployed model) through the `ContainerManager`. To support different container orchestration frameworks that manage Docker containers in different ways, we create different implementations of the `ContainerManager` interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clipper currently provides two `ContainerManager` implementations: the `DockerContainerManager` and the `KubernetesContainerManager`. In this exercise, you will be using the `DockerContainerManager`, which runs Clipper directly on your local Docker instance. This `ContainerManager` is particularly useful for trying out Clipper without needing to set up an enterprise-grade container orchestration framework. The `DockerContainerManager` is not recommended for production use cases."

It is important to note that creating a new connection object does not connect to Clipper - a good thing because there is no running Clipper instance to connect to!\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we connect, we need to start Clipper - which we will address in the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Returning to the process of creating a new connection object, we realize that the first step is to create a `DockerContainerManager` object. The `DockerContainerManager` constructor takes `docker_ip_address` as a keyword argument. Generally, since we want the Clipper cluster to be run locally, we can omit this argument, as its default value is `127.0.0.1`, which will suit our purposes in this case as well."

    "To improve performance during inference, many machine learning models exploit opportunities for data parallelism in the inference process. Because of this, Clipper tries to provide multiple inputs at once to a deployed model.

Returning predictions as strings provides a lot of flexibility over what your models can return.

    "One of the goals of Clipper is to make it simple to deploy and maintain machine-learning models in production. The prediction interface that models must implement is very simple, consisting of a single function. And the use of Docker makes it easy to include all of a model's dependencies in a self-contained environment. However, deploying a new type of model still entails writing and debugging a new model container and creating a Docker image.\n",
    "To make the model deployment process even simpler, Clipper provides a library of model deployers for common types of models. If your model can be deployed with one of these deployers, you no longer need to write a model container, create a Docker image, or even figure out how to save a model. Instead, you provide your trained model directly to the model deployer function within your Python process. The model deployer takes care of saving the model and building a Docker image that is compatible with your model type.\n",

Starting in version 0.3.0, users are also offered the ability to specify packages to install via pip on new model containers during their startup using the `pkgs_to_install` keyword argument.

In addition, since we are no longer dealing with a Python API, but rather with a C executable, we will see that our predict function will be different.\n",
